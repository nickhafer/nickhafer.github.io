      <h1>Where Can I See My First UFO?</h1>
      <p>Analyzing reported UFO sightings across time and space to find where you're most likely to see your first unidentified flying object</p>

      <!-- introduction -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        For centuries, the phenomenon of Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sightings has captivated and intrigued people around
        the world. From mysterious lights moving across the sky to inexplicable aerial phenomena, the allure of a potential
        extraterrestrial encounter has led many fanatics to ask, “When and where is the next UFO going to show up?” We
        understand our readers may not be UFO experts, so this question can be rephrased to, “When and where can I see my first
        UFO?” Using this data, we hope to answer that question, and provide you with the time and place to see your first
        extraterrestrial encounter.
      </section>

      <!-- dataset -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        This dataset contains over 80,000 reported UFO sightings from 1906 to 2014. It’s cross-national and cross-continental,
        allowing us to reveal trends that might exist outside of just the US, where most reporting occurs. For our readers in
        other countries, our interactive visualizations will help you find the time and place for your first alien encounter.

      <!-- geographic distribution -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        We know that plane tickets can be prohibitively expensive unless bought well in advance, so the first item on our to-do
        list is to find where you need to go. Below, we made this nifty geographic heat map that groups together UFO sightings
        by location. Please poke around and explore sightings near you. Then zoom out a little, and identify where the most
        sightings occur. If you’re in the US, you might want to look at southern California as a starting point. The density of
        these sightings could be correlated with different factors such as population density, cultural interest in UFOs, and
        the availability of reporting mechanisms. In particular, the United States stands out with the highest concentration of
        sightings, potentially due to its rich history of UFO culture and higher levels of documentation.

        Now that you know where to book your next flight, the next step is knowing when to book your flight. We understand that
        not all of our readers have access to a time machine, but if you do, 2010 (for our US readers) is a good year to travel
        back to. If you’re unfortunate enough to not have a time machine though, don’t fret, you’re still in good hands. Due to
        increased public reporting and internet access to share those reports, there’ve been an increase in UFO sightings over
        the past 30 years (see below). Other technological advancements have made it much easier to record sightings, like
        cameras and smartphones. This means that traveling in the present day is totally fine, there are plenty of sightings to
        go around. The rise in cultural and media fascination with UFOs over the years has also likely played a role in
        increased reports.

      <!-- day to visit -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        Now that you know which year to book your flight, let’s explore what time of the week is best to get a good chance at
        seeing your first UFO. Our data shows that Saturdays are at least 16% more likely to land you your first UFO sighting
        than any other single day of the week. However, if we had to recommend a three day trip, you’d have your best luck with
        Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The skew in this data could likely be due to a reporting bias. People are more likely to
        be engaged in outdoor and recreational activities on weekends. This gives them a better chance of being outside in order
        to view the UFOs.

      <!-- time of day to visit -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        At this point, you should have booked your flights to allow you to be in prime UFO sighting location (ex: southern
        california mountains) on a Saturday. So what time should you be looking up at the sky? Our data reveals a spike in UFO
        sightings starting at 5pm, but really increases around 7pm, peaking at 9pm, and then dropping after midnight. This means
        that to have the highest chance of spotting a UFO, you should be outside 7-11pm. However, this data also correlates with
        when people are likely finished with dinner to when people usually go to bed. Additionally it’s easy to mistake a comet,
        meteor, or satellite for something that is a UFO if you don’t know what you’re looking for.

      <section class="narrative-text">
        To optimize your UFO-spotting venture even further, our heat map combines data by the day of the week and time of day.
        This shows, yet again, that Saturday nights are prime time for sightings, confirming that leisure time plus optimal
        viewing conditions significantly affect the probability of spotting a UFO. We also want to make sure we have clear
        skies, so which season is best?

      <!-- season to visit -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        Well, when it comes to seasonal UFO sightings, it seems summer is the best, with autumn being the next runner up. Warmer
        weather leads to more outdoor activities which means more people are looking up at the sky. Also, seasonal meteor
        showers are more likely to occur in the summer than any other season, leading to a higher number of UFO reports. But
        what about clearer skies? Apparently the clearest skies are in the winter, due to shorter daylight hours and the colder,
        crisper air which eliminates haze and clouds in the night sky. Don’t worry though! It could be the case that aliens use
        the clouds to hide better, which means maybe they visit us more in the summer, when they have better cloud cover.

      <!-- additional tips -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        Beyond these primary insights, several additional factors could enhance your UFO-spotting experience. For instance,
        staying informed about significant astronomical events, such as meteor showers, may help distinguish between natural
        phenomena and potential UFOs. Moreover, being in a location with low light pollution can improve your chances of
        witnessing something extraordinary in the night sky. For example, if you pick southern California, you might want to
        stay away from Los Angeles.
      </section>

      <!-- conclusion -->
      <section class="narrative-text">
        So, where can you see your first UFO? According to the data, your best bet is to find a hotspot in the United States or
        Europe using our map (depending on where you live), plan your night watching for a Saturday evening during the summer
        months, and ensure you are in an area with clear skies and minimal light pollution.
